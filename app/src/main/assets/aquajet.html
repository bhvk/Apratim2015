		<p><i>Design single stage water rocket using a plastic container preferably a soft.Bottle that uses a combination of pressurized air and water for propulsion to complete a defined task.A launcher should also be constructed that could launch the water rocket safely.  
		</i></p>
<p>DESIGN SPECIFICATION:</p>
<p><ol>
<li>The capacity of the plastic container to be used should be less than or equal to 2 litres.</li>
<li>Only water and coke should be used as propellant. No other gas is allowed to Be pressurised and provide thrust to the rocket(foot pumps and hand pumps can be used).</li>
<li>The maximum pressure should not exceed 60 psi.</li>
<li>Only the above given propellant should be used for launching (Mentos can be used).No other potential, kinetic, or any other form of energy will be permitted for the Launch.</li>
<li>The Launcher must remain stationary on the ground while and after the Launching of the rocket.</li>
<li>No component or body part of the rocket should get detached from main frame during .The flight of the rocket. If detached then the rocket will be disqualified.</li>
<li>The flange and the mouth of bottle can be used to hold the rocket while pressurizing.</li>
<li>Upper tip of rocket should be visible and marked red.</li>
<li>No electronic device can be used.</li>
<li>The launching mechanism should be such that participant is enable to launch the rocket safely from the launcher.</li>

</ol></p>
<p>SAFETY PRECAUTIONS, HINTS AND TIPS</p>
<p><ol>
<li>To keep rocket more aerodynamically stable there is a rule of thumb that states that the centre of drag (COD) should be 1-2 times the distance equal to rocket diameter,behind the Centre of Gravity (COG). Where COD can be found by making a cardboard cut-out of the sideways view of the rocket and finding its centre of gravity.</li>
<li>To lower COD you can use wings or to rise COG try using weights a Nose of Rocket.</li>
<li>Be careful while experimenting with water rocket. Use of excessive pressure might lead to accident.</li>
<li>Do not use mineral water bottles as they cannot withstand the high pressure. Use soft drink bottle.</li>
<li>Do not use any metallic part in rocket as it can cause harm.</li>
<li>Safety goggles are advised to be worn by the competitors.</li></ol></p>
	<h2>Rules</h2>
The competition will be carried out in two rounds:
<p>Round 1: Eliminations</p>
		<p><ol>
			<li>The task is to cover maximum horizontal distance.</li>
                        <li>The place where rep tip will fall will be considered for scoring.</li>
                        <li>Two trials will be given to the participants and the best of the two horizontal distances(in meters) will be considered as score.</li>
<li>Participants are allowed to use different free fliers for this round.</li>     
<li>The teams who successfully crosses a specified distance will be eligible for finals.</li>                   
</ol>
		</p>
<p>Round 2: Finals</p>
<p><ol>
<li>The task is to make the rocket land on the defined zones to earn maximum points.</li>
<li>Two trails will be given and best of two will be considered as round 2 score.</li>
<li>Participants are allowed to use different rockets for this round.</li>
<li>Team with highest scoring will be declared as the WINNER.</li></ol></p>
<p>Scoring Total= Round 1 Score + Round 2 Score</p>
Team size a maximum no of 2 members in a team. Students from different educational institutes are allowed to make a team.

<h2>Disqualification</h2>
Any of following if satisfied may lead to disqualification of a team:
<p><ol>
<li>Rocket found dangerous by organizers and judges.</li>
<li>The Rocket don't have a triggering safety launch from a distance of 2m from the launcher.</li>
<li>Rocket blast before launch.</li>
<li>Design rule not abided by the participants.</li>
<li>Rocket launches before permitted by the judges.</li>
<li>The organizers reserve all rights to change any of the above rules as they deem fit.</li>
<li>In case of a discrepancy decision of the judges shall be treated as final and binding on all.</li>
</ol></p>
<h2>Certificates and Prizes</h2>
			<p><ol>
			<li>Cerificates of participation will be given to all the paricipating teams.</li>
			<li>Certificates of Excellence and prize money will be awarded to the winning teams.</li>
