		<p><i>Design a free flying (no external power) object like a glider. The participant will launch it into the air and the main task is to keep it airborne for maximum horizontal distance and aiming for maximum time of flight. 
		</i></p>
<p>DESIGN SPECIFICATION:</p>
<p><ol>
<li>The dimensions of the glider should not be more than  60cm x 60cm x 15cm.</li>
<li>No external power source can be used like electric motor, RC controllers etc. </li>
<li>The free flier cannot be made out of sharp metals or should not have sharp edges etc.</li>
<li>However participants may use some techniques to make their free flier aerodynamic.</li>
<li>The participant must remain stationary on the ground while and after the launching of the free flier.</li>
<li>No component or body part of the free flier should get detached from main frame during the flight.If detached then the team will be disqualified.</li>
<li>No electronic device can be used.</li>

</ol></p>
<p>SAFETY PRECAUTIONS, HINTS AND TIPS</p>
<p><ol>
<li>A glider is a very good example of a free flying object.</li>
<li>A glider is nothing more nor less than a refined paper dart.If it is launched to a given height in still air conditions it will move forward horizontally relatively rapidly and descend vertically relatively slowly in rather the same way as a cyclist can freewheel down a hill. </li>
<li>The action of the air in keeping the glider airborne or even gaining height is called (rather unimaginatively) 'lift'</li></ol></p>
	<h2>Rules</h2>
The competition will be carried out in two rounds:
<p>Round 1: Eliminations</p>
		<p><ol>
			<li>The task is to cover maximum horizontal distance.</li>
                        <li>The place where rep tip will fall will be considered for scoring.</li>
                        <li>Two trials will be given to the participants and the best of the two horizontal distances(in meters) will be considered as score.</li>
<li>Participants are allowed to use different free fliers for this round.</li>     
<li>The teams who successfully crosses a specified distance will be eligible for finals.</li>                   
</ol>
		</p>
<p>Round 2: Finals</p>
<p><ol>
<li>The task is to make the free fliers land on the defined zones to earn maximum points.</li>
<li>Two trails will be given and best of two will be considered as round 2 score.</li>
<li>Participants are allowed to use different rockets for this round.</li>
<li>Team with highest scoring will be declared as the WINNER.</li></ol></p>
<p>Scoring Total= Round 1 Score + Round 2 Score</p>
Team size a maximum no of 2 members in a team. Students from different educational institutes are allowed to make a team.

<h2>Disqualification</h2>
Any of following if satisfied may lead to disqualification of a team:
<p><ol>
<li>Free flier found dangerous by organizers and judges.</li>
<li>Free flier launched  before permitted by the judges.</li>
<li>Design rule not abided by the participants.</li>
<li>Rocket launches before permitted by the judges.</li>
<li>The organizers reserve all rights to change any of the above rules as they deem fit.</li>
<li>In case of a discrepancy decision of the judges shall be treated as final and binding on all.</li>
</ol></p>
<h2>Certificates and Prizes</h2>
			<p>
				<ol>
			<li>Cerificates of participation will be given to all the paricipating teams.</li>
			<li>Certificates of Excellence and prize money will be awarded to the winning teams.</li>
