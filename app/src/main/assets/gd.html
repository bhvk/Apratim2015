		<p><i>If you believe that your words have conviction and are bound to master everyone else opinion then its time to show off your skills and enchant competitors in your style.Group discussion is a literary event, which helps to summarize ideas of information that a group of informants may come to hold as a group rather than the information held by individual members. The general idea is that each participant will act to stimulate ideas to the other people present and that by process of discussion the collective view becomes greater than sum of individual parts.A genuine dialogue is never easy, it requires a fundamental open-ness to the other mutual listening and sharing.This purpose is satisfied by a group discussion wholly and solely.
