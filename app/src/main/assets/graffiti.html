		<p><i>"Graffiti is one of the few tools you have if you have almost anything. And even if you don't come up with a picture to cure world poverty you can make someone smile while they're passing."
Writing graffiti is the most honest way of being an artist. Give the usual art a backseat and let aerosol art work with your imagination and let your graffiti be a revolution.
