		<p><i>This event involves an autonomous robot which follows black line on a white background. The team that covers the track first, wins.
		</i></p>

			<h2>Rules</h2>
		<p>
		<ol>
			<li>The competition is open to everyone studying in College/University across India, irrespective of his or her branch and year of study.</li>
			<li>Maximum number of participants per team is three. Individual participants are allowed as well.</li>
			<li>The robot will have to follow the black line, from start to finish for successful completion of the track.</li>
			<li>The event comprises of two rounds.</li>
			<li>Teams will be given a maximum of 10 minutes to complete the track.</li>
                        <li>Dimensional and weight limits for robots shall be strictly enforced. Robots must have passed inspection prior to competing.</li>
                        <li>Time is measured from the time the robot crosses the starting line until the time it crosses the finish line. A robot is deemed to have crossed the line when the forward most wheel, track, or leg of the robot contacts or crosses over the line.</li>
                        <li>Once a robot has crossed the starting line it must remain fully autonomous, or it will be disqualified.</li>
                        <li>A robot that wanders off of the arena surface will be disqualified. A robot shall be deemed to have left the arena when any wheel, leg, or track has moved completely off the arena surface.</li>
                        <li>Any robot that loses the line course must reacquire the line at the point where it was lost, or at any earlier (e.g. already traversed) point.</li>
                        <li>After every hand-touch, robot will have to begin from the last checkpoint cleared, and will face a penalty. If the team fails to clear even the first checkpoint, the team will begin from the starting line. No extra time will be given.</li>
                        <li>If a machine is not able to complete the track then the machine that has crossed most checkpoints will be placed higher in the rankings. If the numbers of check points cleared are also same then the team with a longer distance travelled from the last checkpoint cleared will be placed higher.</li>
                        <li>Teams are responsible for any unwanted or unanticipated robot behaviour during the competition.</li>
                        <li>The decisions of all officials regarding these rules and the conduct of the event would be final, and reserve all rights to eliminate the participation of any teams who indulge in any informal activities.</li>
                        <li>Arguments are strongly discouraged.</li>
