		<div align="left" id="di">

		<p><i>This is autonomous robotics where electronic gadget bots are preloaded with programs so that robots can travel through maze, automatically finding correct path to come out of the maze using electrical sensors. After this, it has to come to its initial position either through the shortest path with less check points or longer paths having more check points which is traced by the bot using intelligence of the programmer.
		</i></p>
<p>Specifications:</p>
<p>ARENA</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Dimensions: 8 ft x 6 ft</li>
<li>Two types of mazes will be given for the two rounds. The maze for the first round will be disclosed just a day before the fest.</li>
<li>A white flex will be attached on the board which contains the figure of the maze.</li>
<li>The maze can consist of Left or Right sharp 90 degree turns;Cross roads and perpendicular intersections;Closed loops of four similar turns.</li></ol></p>
<p>BOT SPECIFICATION</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Maximum size- 30*30*30 cubic centimetres & minimum size- 10*10*10 cubic centimetres.</li>
<li>The bots will be checked for size before the start of the event, and must have passed inspection prior to competing.</li>
<li>No major change in bot will be allowed after successful registration.</li>
<li>Lego kits are not allowed for the event.</li>
<li>No overhead cameras are allowed.</li>
<li>The bot can be powered from battery, SMPS, Wireless Connection.</li>
</ol></p>

			<h2>Rules</h2>
		<p>
		<ol>
			<li>Each team can have a maximum of 4 team members, studying in any College/University across India, irrespective of his or her branch and year of study. They must hold a valid College Identity Card.</li>
			<li>The competition consists of two rounds.</li>
			<li>In the first round, the bot will be started off from a starting point of maze and given enough time to reach its destination i.e. the Finishing Point. Once it has reached the Finish Point, a timer will be started to note the time required to reach the starting point.</li>
			<li>Lesser time taken to reach starting point will earn more scores.</li>
			<li>The second round consists of a 3-D maze. Time will be noted for both side journey (starting to finishing point and back) for this round.</li>
                        <li>If a bot gets stuck at a particular point or needs time out, then after the time out bot will be placed from the starting point of the previous check point it has crossed.</li>
                        <li>Maximum time out allowed will be twice for 2 minutes each.</li>
                        <li>A bot can take restart for maximum 3 times. After that the team will be disqualified.</li>
                        <li>If a machine is not able to complete the track then the machine that has crossed most checkpoints will be placed higher in the rankings. If the numbers of check points cleared are also same then the team with a longer distance travelled from the last checkpoint cleared will be placed higher.</li>
                        <li>We reserve the right to disqualify robots at any time if, in our sole opinion, we determine that they are unsafe and could damage property or harm other people.</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
<p>SCORING</p>
SCORE = (100*T)+(50*CP)-(25*O)-(50*R)
</br>
T=time left out by bot for return journey, as maximum time allowed for return journey will be 15mins.
</br>
CP=Check Point crossed.
</br>
O=Time Outs
</br>
R=Restart
			
			<h2>Certificates and Prizes</h2>
